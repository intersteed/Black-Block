Welcome to the development of the Black Block mod for the Neoforged Fancy Mod Loader!

Note: We have completely ported over to minecraft version 1.21.1 as it is currently the most stable.

If syncing to the IDE runs out of memory, you may need to exit out of your IDE and run the task createMinecraftArtifacts and then go back into your IDE to complete the sync.
